Collaborative online code editor

## Team Name
NP-Incomplete

## Members
* Adrian Chen
* Domenic Murtari

## Overview
We will be building a collaborative online code editor. For this we plan on using a collaborative tool to sync the text, and plan on having highlighting tools for ease of readability. We plan on having the feature of running JavaScript code inside the app after having written it which will allow the ability to write JavaScript with WebGL and create 3D models. Also, we want to add support for the website being able to be used in hackathons so that teams could use it to collaborate more easily.

## Technology
* Ruby on Rails
* PubNub (Tool for collaborative purposes)
* Ace editor (JavaScript library for editing code within a browser)
